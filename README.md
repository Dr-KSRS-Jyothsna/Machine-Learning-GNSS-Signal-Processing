# GNSS Signal Processing using Machine Learning

This repository demonstrates the application of **Machine Learning techniques** to
**Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal processing**, focusing on improving
navigation reliability under challenging conditions such as **multipath interference,
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation, and signal anomalies**.

The project showcases an **end-to-end data science workflow**, integrating
domain-specific GNSS knowledge with modern machine learning methodologies.

## Key Focus Areas
- GNSS signal preprocessing and quality assessment  
- Feature extraction in time and frequency domains  
- Detection of multipath effects and signal anomalies  
- Supervised machine learning models for classification and prediction  
- Model evaluation using domain-relevant and statistical performance metrics  

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**  
   Raw GNSS measurements are cleaned, normalized, and segmented for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Statistical and signal-based features are extracted to capture GNSS signal behavior
   under LOS, multipath, and NLOS conditions.

3. **Model Development**  
   Supervised ML algorithms are trained to identify signal degradation and anomalies.

4. **Performance Evaluation**  
   Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and
   GNSS-specific performance indicators.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Techniques:** Signal Processing, Feature Engineering, Supervised Learning  

## Objective

To demonstrate how **machine learning can be effectively integrated with GNSS signal
processing** for both **research-driven investigations** and **industry-oriented
navigation applications**, including intelligent positioning systems and robust
location-based services.
